I'll help you update the README.md file. Based on the current codebase, I notice the existing README.md is a basic Docusaurus template. Let's create a more comprehensive README that better reflects the project.

Here's the updated README.md content:

```markdown
# AREA Documentation Website

This repository contains the documentation website for the AREA (Action-REAction) project, built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/).

## Overview

AREA is a software suite similar to IFTTT or Zapier that allows users to create automated workflows by connecting various services. This documentation site provides comprehensive information about the project's architecture, implementation, and usage.

## Key Features

- Detailed documentation of system architecture
- Technical guides for all components (Backend, Web Client, Mobile Client)
- API documentation and integration guides
- Development setup instructions
- Testing documentation

## Local Development

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
yarn
```

2. Start the development server:
```bash
yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Building for Production

```bash
yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory that can be served using any static hosting service.

## Docker Deployment

You can also run the documentation site using Docker:

```bash
# Build the Docker image
make build_img

# Start the server
make start_serv

# To update the website
make update_website
```

The documentation will be available at `http://localhost:8084`.

## Project Structure

- `/docs/` - Documentation content
- `/src/` - React components and custom pages
- `/static/` - Static files like images
