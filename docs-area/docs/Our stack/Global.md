## MyArea Network Architecture

### Overview
This diagram provides a high-level overview of the MyArea network architecture. It outlines the key components and their interactions.

### Components

* **CDN (Cloudflare):** 
  * Delivers static content rapidly, improving website performance and user experience.
* **NGINX:**
  * Acts as a reverse proxy, routing traffic to the appropriate backend services based on the incoming request.
* **Node.js (API):** 
  * The backend API responsible for handling business logic and data processing.
* **Next.js:**
  * The frontend framework used to build the website's user interface.
* **Flutter:**
  * The framework used to develop the mobile application.
* **DevOps Server:**
  * Provides a development environment, including a CLI for developers to interact with the system.

### Workflow
1. **User Request:** A user accesses the MyArea website or mobile app.
2. **CDN:** The request is initially routed to the CDN, which serves static assets (e.g., images, CSS, JavaScript) from a cache if available, improving load times.
3. **NGINX:** For dynamic content or API requests, NGINX forwards the request to the appropriate backend service (Node.js API).
4. **Node.js API:** The API processes the request, interacts with the database (not shown), and generates the necessary response.
5. **Response:** The response is sent back to the user, either directly from the CDN or via NGINX.

### Key Technologies
* **Cloudflare:** A popular content delivery network.
* **NGINX:** A high-performance web server and reverse proxy.
* **Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime environment.
* **Next.js:** A React framework for building server-rendered React applications.
* **Flutter:** A UI software development kit for creating natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.

### Additional Notes
* **DevOps:** The DevOps team is responsible for maintaining and improving the infrastructure, as well as providing tools and processes for developers.
* **CLI:** The command-line interface allows developers to interact with the system for tasks such as debugging, deploying code, and running tests.
* **Webhooks:** The development server receives webhooks, which are HTTP POST requests that are sent to an HTTP callback URL to provide information about an event that has taken place.

**This documentation provides a basic overview of the MyArea network architecture. For more detailed information, please refer to the specific documentation for each component.**

**Possible Enhancements:**
* **Database:** Include a diagram of the database schema and its relationship to the other components.
* **Security:** Discuss the security measures in place, such as authentication, authorization, and data encryption.
* **Scalability:** Explain how the architecture can scale to handle increased traffic or data.
* **Deployment:** Describe the deployment process and the tools used (e.g., CI/CD pipelines).
